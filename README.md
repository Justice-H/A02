Branch  - Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.
Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch
into another branch using a pull request. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely
experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
Clone - When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
Commit - You can save small groups of meaningful changes as commits. Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies: The specific changes, When the changes were made, Who created the changes.
