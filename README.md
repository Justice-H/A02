Glossary:
**Branch**  - Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.
Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch
into another branch using a pull request. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely
experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

**Clone** - When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your
repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

**Commit** - You can save small groups of meaningful changes as commits. Similar to saving a file that's
been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a
unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies: The specific changes, When the changes were made,
Who created the changes.

**Fetch** - To retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new 
remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.

**GIT** - a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files.
 
**Github** - GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together 
with others to write code.

**Merge** - Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), 
and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" 
(which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line.
 
**Merge Conflict** -A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when 
people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file 
and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.
 
**Push** - To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. 
For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

**Pull** - Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, 
if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those 
changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

**Remote** - This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, 
most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

**Repository** - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's 
folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's 
revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
